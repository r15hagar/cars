What Drives the Ptice of a Car?

In this project I explored a portion of a dataset contiaining information on cars. My goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. My analysis provides a recommendation to potential clients (used car dealerships) as to what consumers value in a used car. We go through some data analysis to see the variance of certain features in used car sales. Then we use Linear regression and ridge models to see what features of the dataset have influence on car prices.
